Throughout the course, we will be using the [Board Game Geek dataset from Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-01-25).

```{r}
# do not edit this block
library(tidyverse) 

ratings <- 
  read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-01-25/ratings.csv') %>%

<u>Tuesday, August 20: Introduction to R and Quarto</u>

**1. How many total observations (rows) are there in the dataset?**

There are 21631 observations(rows) are there in the dataset(bgg).

**2. List the first 5 variables (columns) in the dataset.**

id, name, year, rank, average, these are the 5 variables(columns) in the dataset(bgg).

<u>Thursday, August 22: Review of Statistical Modeling</u>

**3. We will be working with the average user rating (*average*), year the game was published (*yearpublished*), and the minimum age suggested to play the game (*minage*), and the. Explore each of these variables: provide the mean with standard deviation, median with IQR, and a histogram to determine the shape of the distribution.**

```{r}

bgg %>%
  summarize(mean_average=round(mean(average, na.rm =TRUE),2),
            sd_average=round(sd(average, na.rm =TRUE),2),
            median_average=round(median(average, na.rm = TRUE),2),
            IQR_average=round(IQR(average, na.rm =TRUE),2))
hist(bgg$average)

bgg%>%
  summarize(mean_yearpublished=round(mean(yearpublished, na.rm =TRUE),2),
            sd_yearpublished=round(sd(yearpublished, na.rm =TRUE),2),
            median_yearpublished=round(median(yearpublished, na.rm = TRUE),2),
            IQR_yearpublished=round(IQR(yearpublished, na.rm =TRUE),2))
hist(bgg$yearpublished)

bgg%>%
  summarize(mean_minage=round(mean(minage, na.rm =TRUE),2),
            sd_minage=round(sd(minage, na.rm =TRUE),2),
            median_minage=round(median(minage, na.rm = TRUE),2),
            IQR_minage=round(IQR(minage, na.rm =TRUE),2))
hist(bgg$minage)







  
```

**4. Model the average user rating (*average*) as a function of year published (*yearpublished*) and minimum age (*minage*). Remember to state (typeset) the resulting model.**

```{r}
m1 <- glm(average ~ yearpublished + minage,
          data = bgg,
          family = "gaussian")
summary(m1)

coefficients(m1)
```

Thus, the resulting model is $$ 
\hat{y}=5.4187+0.0002x_1+0.0473x_2
$$ where,

$y$ is the average,

$x_1$ is the yearpublished, and

$x_2$ is the minage.

```{r}
full <- glm(average ~ yearpublished + minage, data = bgg, family = "gaussian")
reduced <- glm(average ~ 1, data = bgg, family = "gaussian")
anova(reduced, full, test = "F")
```

**5. Let's scale the predictors -- note that in your model, you should see very small coefficients, which does not make for a meaningful interpretation. Perform the appropriate data management steps to scale the year published by 25 years and to scale the minimum age by 5 years.**

```{r}
bgg$yearpublished_scaled <- bgg$yearpublished/25
bgg$minage_scaled <- bgg$minage/5

```

**6. Reconstruct your model from Q4 using the scaled predictors from Q5. Remember to state (typeset) the resulting model.**

```{r}
m2 <- glm(average ~ yearpublished_scaled + minage_scaled,
          data = bgg,
          family = "gaussian")
summary(m2)
coefficients(m2)
```

Thus, the resulting model is $$ 
\hat{y}=5.418+0.006x_1+0.236x_2
$$ where,

$y$ is the average,

$x_1$ is the yearpublished_scaled, and

$x_2$ is the minage_scaled.

```{r}
full_scaled <- glm(average ~ yearpublished_scaled + minage_scaled, data = bgg, family = "gaussian")
reduced_scaled <- glm(average ~ 1, data = bgg, family = "gaussian")
anova(reduced_scaled, full_scaled, test = "F")
```

**7. Let's compare the model results from Q4 and Q6.**

-   **What do you notice when you compare the** $\hat{\beta}_i$ values?

    -   I have observed the change of values after scaling the predictors. Results of Q6 have small coefficients compared to Q4.
    -   In Q4, $\hat{\beta}_{yearpublished}$=0.0002, $\hat{\beta}_{minage}$=0.0473
    -   In Q6, $\hat{\beta}_{yearpublished_scaled}$=0.006, $\hat{\beta}_{minage_scaled}$=0.236

-   **What do you notice when you compare the test statistics and** $p$-values?

    -   The test statistics and p-values are same in both the cases.
    -   $F_o$=454.42 and p\<0.001

**8. Is the model in Q6 significant at the** $\alpha$ = 0.05 level? You must typeset the results of your hypothesis test.

```{r}
full_scaled <- glm(average ~ yearpublished_scaled + minage_scaled, data = bgg, family = "gaussian")
reduced_scaled <- glm(average ~ 1, data = bgg, family = "gaussian")
anova(reduced_scaled, full_scaled, test = "F")

summary(m2)
```

-   **Hypotheses**

    -   $H_0$: model in Q6 is not significant.
    -   $H_1$: model in Q6 is significant.

-   **Test Statistic and** $p$-Value

    -   $F_{0}=454.42$
    -   $p<0.001$

-   **Rejection Region**

    -   Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$; $\alpha =0.05$.

-   **Conclusion and Interpretation**

    -   Reject $H_0$.

    -   As the p\<0.05, There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the model is significant .

**9. Are there any significant predictors of average rating at the** $\alpha$ = 0.05 level? You must typeset the results of your hypothesis tests.

```{r}
summary(m2)
```

    -   $H_0$: It is not a significant predictor of average
    -   $H_1$: It is a significant predictor of average

    -   As the p-value \< $\alpha$There is sufficient evidence to suggest that minage is a significant predictor of average.

<u>Tuesday, August 27: Introduction of Categorical Predictors</u>

**10. Let's explore the player variables a little more.**

-   **What are the possible responses in the minimum number of players?**

```{r}
head(bgg, n=5)
bgg %>% count(minplayers)

library(fastDummies)
bgg <- bgg %>% 
  dummy_cols(select_columns = c("minplayers")) 

bgg %>%
  select(starts_with("minplayers")) %>%
  head(3)


```

-   **What are the possible responses in the maximum number of players?**

```{r}
head(bgg, n=5)
bgg %>% count(maxplayers)

library(fastDummies)
bgg <- bgg %>% 
  dummy_cols(select_columns = c("maxplayers")) 

bgg %>%
  select(starts_with("maxplayers")) %>%
  head(3)


```

**11. Let's treat minimum and maximum number of players as categorical variables, however, they have too many categories for reasonable interpretation. Perform the appropriate data management steps to create the following variables:**

-   **an indicator for games that require 2 players**

-   **a character variable classifying games as follows:**

    -   ***minplayers***$\in$ {0, 1} $\to$ "1 - not interested"
    -   ***minplayers***$\in$ {2, 3} $\to$ "2 - can play with family"
    -   ***minplayers*** **\> 3** $\to$ "3 - can play with friends"

```{r}
library(fastDummies)
bgg <- bgg %>%
  mutate(games = ifelse(minplayers == 2, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(games_classification = case_when(
    minplayers %in% c(0,1) ~ "1 - not interested",
    minplayers %in% c(2, 3) ~ "2 - can play with family",
    minplayers > 3 ~ "3 - can play with friends"))

bgg %>%
  select(minplayers, games, games_classification) %>%
  head(n = 100)

```

**12. Model the average user rating (*average*) as a function of games that require 2 players (variable from Q11) and scaled minimum age (variable from Q5). Remember to state (typeset) the resulting model.**

```{r}
m3 <- glm(average ~ games + minage_scaled,
          data = bgg,
          family = "gaussian")
summary(m3)
coefficients(m3)
```

Thus, the resulting model is $$  \hat{y}=6.15-0.24x_1+0.23x_2 $$ where,

$y$ is the average,

$x_1$ is the games, and

$x_2$ is the minage_scaled.

**13. Are there any significant predictors of average rating at the** $\alpha$ = 0.05 level? You must typeset the results of your hypothesis tests.

```{r}
car::Anova(m3, type = 3)

summary(m3)
```

***Test for minimum of 2 players***

    -   $p$\<0.001

-   **Rejection Region**

    -   Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$; $\alpha =0.05$.

-   **Conclusion and Interpretation**

    -   Reject $H_0$.

    -   As the p-value\< alpha, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that minimum age is a significant predictor of average.

          data = bgg,
          family = "gaussian")
summary(m4)
coefficients(m4)
```

Thus, the resulting model is $$  \hat{y}=6.45-0.57x_1-0.67x_2+0.23x_3 $$ where,

$y$ is the average,

$x_1$ is the games for minplayers $\in${2,3}

$x_2$ is the games for minplayers \>3, and

$x_3$ is the minage_scaled.

    -   t1=-35.41, t2=-17.36
    -   p\<0.001

-   **Rejection Region**

    -   Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$; $\alpha =0.05$.

-   **Conclusion and Interpretation**

    -   reject H0
    -   as the p-value\<alpha, there is enough evidence to suggest that atleast one slope is not equal to zero,therefore the game classification is a significant predictor for average.
